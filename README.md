# Revised-Connect4
 A REVISED VERSION OF CLASSIC GAME CONNECT 4. IN THIS VERSION OF THE GAME, WE WILL NOT BE LIMITED TO 6X7 BOARDS. FURTHERMORE, PLAY WILL ALWAYS CONTINUE UNTIL THE BOARD IS COMPLETELY FULL (EVEN AFTER A PLAYER HAS ACHIEVED 4-IN-A-ROW), AT WHICH POINT SCORES FOR EACH PLAYER WILL BE CALCULATED. THE PLAYER WITH THE HIGHEST SCORE WINS.
